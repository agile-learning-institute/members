## Before Creating new Repositories

Since GitHub does not have the concepts of folders to organize repositories, we are using a naming convention to make it easy to find related code. All stageZero repositories should be created in the agile-learning-institute organization. The repositories should follow this convention ```member-[name]-[project]```. You are free to choose project names as you see fit, but we ask that all repositories be prefixed with ```member-[yourname]-``` to make it easy to find all of your projects.
