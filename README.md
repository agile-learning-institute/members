## Before Creating new Repositories

Since GitHub does not have the concepts of folders to organize repositories, we are using a naming convention to make it easy to find related code. 
- When you create a new repo, make sure the owner is ``agile-learning-institute``
- Give the repo a name that follows this format ```member-[yourname]-[yourproject```
- Give it a description
- Make sure it's Public
- Make sure you check "Create a README"
After creating the repo in this way, you can use ``git clone`` to clone it down to your computer and work on your project.
